Introduction
------------

A Dark Dawn is a very good game. It tells a deep story of a man who searches the love of his live.
Will he succed? Find out in this very game!

Actually it was written for the FuckThisJam.
It's not serious or good. See it as a little satire of those games you sometimes see on retsupurae :)

The game is written in C# and uses the Unity engine.

If you find any bugs please inform me at <xrcore@aol.de>. Cheers!

Installation

The repo includes all source files that are needed to build a working copy of the game in
Unity.
